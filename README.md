# ACM latex template

- Template for conference
- Compile two versions, writing and submission. In writing version, we defined a set of commands to mark changed text (see main.tex).

- Original template in latex_template.zip, which is downloaded from https://www.asplos-conference.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/asplos25-templates.zip
- Local compile: make
- Overleaf: uncomment this line of code in main.tex to generate submission version while using overleaf

``` tex
 \newcommand{\submitmode}{true}
```
